# BMPLIST - BITMAP file handling, Doubly linked list and VGA Graphics programming experiment

This small program just a the title says, opens a list of bmp files and store them on a doubly linked list, each frame is animated using VGA Mode X and double-buffering.

On the future i'll work on more IO functions such as keyboard and mouse handling, maybe sound too, currently i need to adquire more skill on the graphics topic, better x86-32 ASM understanding and memory managment with protected mode.

Compiled with Watcom C 10.6 by simply just using 

wcl386.exe bmplist2.c
